## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

````{r}
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(nlme)
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
library(ez)
library(lsr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(MASS)
library(doBy)
library(plyr)
library(numDeriv)

##PC
#data=read_excel("/Users/jbrown/Documents/GitHub/Lipid_Quantification/Data/Extraction Samples JLM.xlsx",sheet = "CONTSAMPdf")


##MAC
## reading in the data and looking at its structure
data=read_excel("/Users/JamesB/Google Drive/Graduate School/Self_JamesTBrown/GitHub/Masters_Thesis/Thesis_Images/diapdiff.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1")
data=gather(data,genotype,measure,long:short)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=data,aes(x=day,y=measure,color=genotype))+
  stat_summary(aes(y = measure), geom="line", size=1)+
  stat_summary(aes(y = measure), geom="point", size=2)+
  scale_color_manual(values=c(long="purple",short="orange"))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
